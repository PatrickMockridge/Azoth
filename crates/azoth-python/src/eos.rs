//! The equations-of-state calculations, exposed to Python.
//!
//! Same rule as `hydraulics.rs` and `thermal.rs`: every parameter below is an SI
//! magnitude, not a `uom` quantity. Here that rule costs nothing, because the
//! quantities in this namespace are dimensionless by construction - the reduced
//! variables and constitutive coefficients an equation of state is written in -
//! so there is no conversion to do at the boundary and no unit string to keep in
//! step with the spec.
