"""The process layer: unit operations and flowsheets.

The ``process.*`` ids, one per palette entry under ``specs/unit_ops/``, and the check
that holds a flowsheet to the calculus's rules. Each id is a registered model: a spec
under ``specs/models/process/``, a kernel in Rust and a reference here, compared by
``test_cross_impl`` against a committed NeqSim capture.

The Stream-level arithmetic those models wrap is :mod:`azoth.process.kernels`, which is
what a flowsheet's executor will call and what ``azoth check`` validates the wiring of.
